# ASCIIFlow Inifinity

This is a fork of the amazing ASCII-based drawing tool [ASCIIFLlow Infinity](https://github.com/lewish/asciiflow2).

My only modification is I've added a Makefile and Dockerfile to make running the thing locally easier.
What you get is a containerized NGINX serving the drawing tool.
You can use it from the browser.

Run:
- `make build` to build the container locally
- `make start` to run it - port 8080 is default
- `make stop` to stop the server
